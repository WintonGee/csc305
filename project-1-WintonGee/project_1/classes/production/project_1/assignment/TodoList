/** TODO List
* General Guidelines
* X return a list of articles with title, description, published date-time, url
* X Supports parsing json (No matter the source)
*
* * Error Guidelines
* X parser to report any parsing errors
* X Skip the articles with errors
* X java.util.logging.Logger, use "Warning" for any errors
* X Maybe have a checker for isValid in article
* X modify disable default log record handler and establish a new handler FileHandler w/ SimpleFormatter
*
* * Testing
* - Test for valid inputs to verify that all articles are parsed.
* - Test for inputs with missing fields.
* - consider overriding the equals method (Not 100%)
*
* * Main
* X input JSON files to your program are the input.json and bad.json (For this assignment)
* X Errors should be logged to the Logger for your "main" class.
*
* * Documentation
* X comment for each non-private method
